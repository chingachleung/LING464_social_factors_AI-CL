# Social Bias in Stanford Natural Language Inferencce Corpus 
Study social bias from crowd-sourced data by looking at what words from the [SNLI Corpus](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) are associated with each other using pointwise mutual information (PMI). In particular, I look into what words are associated to gender-related and ethnictiy-related terms. Here is the list of the terms:

1. woman
2. man
3. girl
4. boy
5. female
6. male
7. mother
8. father
9. American
10. Mexican
